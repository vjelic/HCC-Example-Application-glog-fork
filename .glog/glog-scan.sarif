                "markdown": "This finding is considered a genuine vulnerability because the classification indicates a risk of undefined behavior due to possible overlap between the source and destination memory regions in the memory copy operation. The analysis detected that both the source and destination may refer to the same underlying object (as they share the same base identifier), which can cause undefined behavior when using memory copy functions like memcpy. Additionally, there are no explicit checks to ensure that the source and destination are not null, which further increases the risk of runtime errors. The absence of bounds checks or guards, and the lack of evidence that the copy size is derived from the actual buffer capacity, all contribute to the severity of this issue.\n\n## In Context Remediation 1\nBefore performing the memory copy, ensure that the source and destination buffers do not overlap. Add a runtime check to verify that the memory regions are distinct. Also, check that neither pointer is null before copying.\n\n```cpp\nif (_verificationInput != nullptr && _input != nullptr &&\n    ((char*)_verificationInput + sizeBytes <= (char*)_input ||\n     (char*)_input + sizeBytes <= (char*)_verificationInput)) {\n    memcpy(_verificationInput, _input, sizeBytes);\n} else {\n    // Handle error: overlapping or null pointers\n}\n```\n\n\n## In Context Remediation 2\nIf overlapping memory regions are possible or cannot be ruled out, use `memmove` instead of `memcpy`, as `memmove` is safe for overlapping regions. Also, check for null pointers before copying.\n\n```cpp\nif (_verificationInput != nullptr && _input != nullptr) {\n    memmove(_verificationInput, _input, sizeBytes);\n} else {\n    // Handle error: null pointers\n}\n```\n\n## References\n- [OWASP C-Based Toolchain Hardening Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [NIST Glossary: Buffer Overflow](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/buffer_overflow)\n- [CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)\n- [CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)\n- [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)\n- [OWASP Buffer Overflow](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Buffer_Overflow)\n- [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)\n\n\n___\n"
