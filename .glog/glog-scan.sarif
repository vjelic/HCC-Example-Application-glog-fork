                "markdown": "This finding is classified as a genuine vulnerability because the analysis identified a risk of undefined behavior due to possible overlap between the source and destination memory regions in the memory copy operation. The source and destination are both members of the same object, which increases the likelihood of overlap. Additionally, there are no checks in place to ensure that the source and destination pointers are non-null, which could lead to null pointer dereference issues. The absence of explicit bounds or capacity checks for the copy size further increases the risk. These factors indicate a real risk of undefined behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.\n\n## In Context Remediation\nTo prevent undefined behavior when copying memory between potentially overlapping regions, ensure that the source and destination do not overlap. If overlap is possible, use `memmove` instead of `memcpy`, as `memmove` is designed to handle overlapping memory safely. Additionally, add explicit checks to ensure that both the source and destination pointers are not null before performing the copy operation. For example:\n\n```cpp\nif (_verificationInput != nullptr && _input != nullptr) {\n    memmove(_verificationInput, _input, sizeBytes);\n}\n```\n\nThis change ensures that the copy operation is safe even if the memory regions overlap and avoids null pointer dereference. Always validate the size parameter to ensure it does not exceed the capacity of either buffer.\n\n## References\n- [OWASP C-Based Toolchain Hardening Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)\n- [CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)\n- [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)\n- [OWASP Buffer Overflow](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Buffer_Overflow)\n\n___\n"
