                "markdown": "This finding is classified as a genuine vulnerability because the analysis identified a risk of undefined behavior due to possible overlap between the source and destination memory regions in the memory copy operation. The source and destination are both members of the same object, which increases the likelihood of overlap. Additionally, there are no checks ensuring that the source and destination pointers are non-null, which could lead to null pointer dereference. The absence of explicit bounds or capacity checks for the copy size further increases the risk. The verdict is supported by the high-confidence classification and the lack of mitigating factors such as non-overlapping memory, null checks, or bounds validation.\n\n## In Context Remediation\nBefore performing the memory copy, ensure that the source and destination pointers are not null and that the memory regions do not overlap. If overlap is possible, use a function that safely handles overlapping regions, such as `memmove`. Also, validate that the copy size does not exceed the capacity of either buffer.\n\n```cpp\nif (_verificationInput != nullptr && _input != nullptr &&\n    ((char*)_verificationInput + sizeBytes <= (char*)_input ||\n     (char*)_input + sizeBytes <= (char*)_verificationInput)) {\n    memcpy(_verificationInput, _input, sizeBytes);\n} else if (_verificationInput != nullptr && _input != nullptr) {\n    // Use memmove if overlap is possible\n    memmove(_verificationInput, _input, sizeBytes);\n} else {\n    // Handle error: one or both pointers are null\n}\n```\n\n## References\n- [OWASP C-Based Toolchain Hardening Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)\n- [CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)\n- [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)\n- [OWASP Buffer Overflow](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Buffer_Overflow)\n\n___\n"
